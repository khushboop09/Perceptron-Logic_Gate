# About
A single layer perceptron maps its input x to the output f(x).<br>
f(x) is a simple binary function also called activation function and can have two possible results either 0 or 1.<br><br>
f(x) = 1 if (w.x+b) > 0, else 0.
<br>where w is a vector of real-valued weights, w.x is the dot product and b is the bias.

# Perceptron-Logic_Gate
Implementation of AND and OR logic gates using a single-layer perceptron.
<br><br>
AND Logic Gate:<br>
| x1 | x2 | output |
|---|---|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0      |
| 0  | 1  | 0      |
| 1  | 0  | 0      |
| 1  | 1  | 1      |

<br><br>
OR Logic Gate:<br>
| x1 | x2 | output |
|---|---|---|
| 0  | 0  | 0      |
| 0  | 1  | 1      |
| 1  | 0  | 1      |
| 1  | 1  | 1      |
